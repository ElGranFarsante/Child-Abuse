    <h1>How Child Abuse and Neglect Affect Childhood?</h1>

    <h2>Hook</h2>
    <p>
      Under optimal conditions, parents buffer young children from stress and
      serve as «co-regulators» of behavior and physiology. Over time, children
      raised by such parents gradually assume these regulatory capacities.
      Although children can cope effectively with mild or moderate stress when
      supported by a caregiver, conditions that exceed their capacities to cope
      adaptively often result in problematic short- or long-term consequences.
      Studies conducted with some nonhuman primate species and rodents have
      shown that the young are dependent on the parent for help in regulating
      behavior and physiology. Thus, young infants are dependent on parents
      fulfilling the functions of carrying, holding, and feeding. Even beyond
      the point at which young children are physically dependent, they remain
      psychologically dependent throughout childhood and adolescence. Thus,
      inadequate or abusive care can have considerable consequences in terms of
      children's health and social, psychological, cognitive, and brain
      development. Children who have experienced abuse and neglect are therefore
      at increased risk for a number of problematic developmental, health, and
      mental health outcomes, including learning problems, problems relating to
      peers, internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and posttraumatic
      stress disorder. As adults, these children continue to show increased risk
      for psychiatric disorders, substance use, serious medical illnesses, and
      lower economic productivity. As discussed in the section on individual
      differences later in this chapter, a body of research is devoted to
      uncovering the factors that distinguish children who do not experience
      problematic outcomes despite facing significant adversity in the form of
      abuse or neglect.

    <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
    <p>
      Several key concepts need to be considered in attempting to understand
      potential pathways that lead from abuse and neglect to the various
      consequences discussed in this chapter and the context in which those
      consequences manifest. Second, child abuse and neglect occur in the
      context of a child's brain development, and their potential effects on
      developing brain structures can help explain the onset of certain negative
      outcomes. Therefore, the most rigorous research on this topic attempts to
      account for the many factors that may be confounded with abuse or neglect.

    <h2>Types of Evidence</h2>
    <p>
      In this prospective, longitudinal study, known as the Bucharest Early
      Intervention Project, 136 children abandoned at or around the time of
      birth and then placed in state-run institutions were extensively studied
      when they ranged in age from 6 to 31 months , as was a sample of 72
      never-institutionalized children who lived with their families in the
      greater Bucharest community. Following the baseline assessment, half of
      the institutionalized children were randomly assigned to a high-quality
      foster care program that the investigators created, financed, and
      maintained, and half were randomly assigned to remain in care as usual .
      These children were followed extensively through age 12 . The discussion
      in this chapter necessarily relies primarily on the strongest
      nonexperimental studies conducted. These studies involve longitudinal
      prospective designs, which assess child abuse and neglect objectively at
      the time of occurrence and assess outcomes longitudinally. A good example
      is the study of Wisdom and colleagues , which followed a large cohort of
      abused and neglected children and a matched comparison sample from
      childhood into adulthood. Other examples include the studies of Johnson
      and colleagues , Noll and colleagues , and Jonson-Reid and colleagues .
      Retrospective designs that ask participants to recall whether abuse and
      neglect were experienced are more troublesome because recall of child
      abuse and neglect can be affected by a variety of factors and open to a
      number of potential biases . Results of studies based on treatment samples
      of adults who experienced maltreatment as children may be potentially
      biased because not all victims of child abuse and neglect seek treatment
      as adults, and because people who do seek treatment may have higher rates
      of problems than people who do not seek treatment . When participants are
      asked to report on conditions such as current depression and previous
      history of child abuse and neglect, the added problem of shared method
      variance arises. This study includes use of multiple data sources and
      record reviews, as well as interviews with children and youth who have
      experienced child abuse and neglect, their caretakers, and child welfare
      workers. Several of its findings are discussed in Chapter 5. This chapter
      contains an extensive review of the more recent biologically based studies
      of child abuse and neglect because of the important advances that have
      been made in this area. Despite recent methodological advances,
      researchers face many challenges in attempting to understand the short-
      and long-term consequences of the various types of child abuse and neglect
      for child functioning and development. One of those challenges is teasing
      apart the impact of child abuse and neglect from that of other
      co-occurring factors. For example, children involved with child protective
      services because of neglect or abuse often face a number of overlapping
      and concurrent risk factors, including poverty, prenatal substance
      exposure, and parent psychopathology, among others . These concurrent risk
      factors can make it particularly difficult to draw causal inferences about
      the specific consequences of abuse and neglect for children's functioning,
      but need to be disentangled from the specific effects of abuse and neglect
      . Considering the course of abuse and neglect may also be particularly
      important, as Jonson-Reid and colleagues found that the number of child
      abuse and neglect reports powerfully predicted adverse outcomes across a
      range of domains.
